# Overview
During the first two weeks, we will mostly cover syntactical problems. These problems should be pretty simple to understand and are designed to help you get familiar with the syntax of your language of choice.  
For those of you who are already quite familiar with one of these languages, I would recommend coding the solutions across multiple languages or starting with a language that is unfamiliar so you can get the most out of your finite time.

### Problem 1 (Simple Sum)
Write a program that, given a list of positive numbers, returns their sum.  

Your program should read from standard input (the keyboard) the following information:  
> On the first line, an integer N, the number of elements in the list.  
> In the following N lines, a positive integer ai represents the number at the i-th position in the list (where i=1,...,N).

Your program should display on the screen a single integer representing the sum of all the numbers in the list.  
  

For example -  
Input:  
> 6  
> 1  
> 6  
> 9  
> 15  
> 15  
> 5  

Output:  
> 51  
  
_Reading and writing using standard input and output will be important for uploading your code to https://www.capitolcoders.com in the future._

### Problem 2 (Dutch National Flag Problem)
Given an array containing only 0’s, 1’s, and 2’s, sort it.  
For those of you looking for an extra challenge, make sure your code runs in linear time and constant space.  

For example -  
> Original: { 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0 }  
> Sorted: { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2 }  

### Problem 3 (Euclidean Algorithm)
With a ___recursive function___, implement the Euclidean Algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two integers.  
For those of you looking for an extra challenge, make your function tail recursive.
